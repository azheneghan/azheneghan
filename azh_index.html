             <p>My name is Andrew Heneghan. I am currently a Mathematics with a Statistics Concentration
 	        major at West Chester University with minors in biology and studio art. After finishing 
		my senior year, I plan to pursue a Master's Degree in Applied Statistics and pursue a career
		in the field of statistics or biostatistics. My great math and science skills have let me
		recieve an annual Math Endowment Awards Scholarship and have put me on the Dean's List since
		my first semester at the university. I also enjoy hobbies such as drawing, painting, and 
		baking outside my professional life.  </p>

 		<p> I have worked as an intern at the West Chester University Office of Institutional Research
		    during the Summer of 2022. I helped organize and stuff folders with teacher evaluation sheets
		    so they would be ready to get picked up by the different college departments. I also created a
		    special program on SAS alongside another math major to help the people there create and organize
		    statistics based on certain student demographics. </p>
